A Smart Hackathon (or Smart Hackathon Project) usually focuses on solving real-world problems using AI / ML, IoT, Web, Mobile Apps, Smart City ideas, etc. 

🚀 Top Smart Hackathon Project Ideas (Easy → Advanced)


✅ 1. Smart Attendance System Using Facial Recognition

Problem: Manual attendance wastes time and can be faked.
Solution: Camera detects student faces and marks attendance automatically.

Tech:

Python, OpenCV, face_recognition

Firebase / MySQL (database)

Web dashboard


✅ 2. AI Resume Scanner (RecruBot)

Problem: HR spends long time filtering resumes.
Solution: AI tool that reads PDFs, extracts skills & experience and gives a match score.

Tech:

NLP (spaCy / HuggingFace)

Python, Flask

Web UI


✅ 3. Smart Waste Management System

Problem: Overflowing dustbins create hygiene issues.
Solution: IoT sensor detects bin level, sends alert to admin dashboard.

Tech:

Ultrasonic sensor, ESP32

MQTT / Firebase

Web dashboard


✅ 4. Women Safety App With Live Tracking

Problem: Safety issues at night or isolated areas.
Solution: One-click alert → sends location to emergency contacts + police.

Tech:

Android Studio (Java/Kotlin)

GPS, SMS API, Firebase

AI unsafe-area detection (optional)


✅ 5. Smart Health Monitoring (IoT + AI)

Problem: Sudden health issues in elderly people.
Solution: Wearable sensor collects heartbeat, oxygen levels → alerts family/hospital.

Tech:

IoT sensors (MAX30100, DHT11)

ESP32

Mobile app


✅ 6. Forest Fire Detection Using IoT + AI

Problem: Fires detected too late → large damage.
Solution: Sensors detect temperature/smoke + AI classifies fire risk.

Tech:

ESP32, Smoke Sensor

Firebase

ML Random Forest model


✅ 7. Traffic Density Control Using AI

Problem: Traffic congestion at cities.
Solution: Camera detects vehicle count → controls signal timing automatically.

Tech:

CNN / YOLO object detection

Python, OpenCV

Raspberry Pi


✅ 8. Smart Blind Stick

Problem: Blind people find difficulty navigating obstacles.
Solution: Stick with ultrasonic sensor + vibration motor + GPS alerts.

Tech:

Arduino / NodeMCU

Ultrasonic sensor

Buzzer/vibrator


✅ 9. Smart Water Leak Detection

Problem: Hidden pipe leaks → water wastage.
Solution: IoT sensors detect moisture + alert instantly.

Tech:

Soil moisture sensor

ESP8266

Mobile alert system



✅ 10. Smart Farming System

Problem: Farmers need automation for irrigation.
Solution: Soil moisture sensors + automated water pump using ML.

Tech:

IoT + ML

NodeMCU + Sensors

Mobile dashboard
